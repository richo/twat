= Twat

Twat is a barebones cli interface to twitter, to let me tweet from my shell,
where I do nearly everything. If it's useful to one person other than me then
it's far exceeded my expectations.

== Release status

Features are implemented pretty much as I see need for them, and I still
haven't put together a test suite so changes may or may not leave the code in
an inconsistent state.

Twat is feature complete enough to allow a user to send tweets without editing
a config file, but much of it's interface is missing/counterintuitive. Support
for sites other than twitter (identi.ca, for example) is planned but not
implemented.

== Credits and thanks

I used a lot the structure from codeplane to work out how to structure it. It's
obviously not as neat, but the gemspec was shamelessly adapted from codeplane

the oauth and Twitter gems saved me from actually having to do much work.

I'm reachable at richo@psych0tik.net, and I contribute to a blog at

== License

Twat is released under the WTFPL ( sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/ ), or, at your option the
GPLv2.

I do request that any useful changes are passed back to me so that I may
incorporate them/see what people are doing with it though.
