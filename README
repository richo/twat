= Twatterator

this is the tweety thing I used for the Singularity Summit

I plan to extend it into (yet another) basic cli tweet app that supports
multiple accounts so that I can harass the world relentlessly (basically use a
twitter feed to replace my code/cheat/ files)

Also as an excuse to learn more ruby in my spare time
