= Twatterator

this is the tweety thing I used for the Singularity Summit

I plan to extend it into (yet another) basic cli tweet app that supports
multiple accounts so that I can harass the world relentlessly (basically use a
twitter feed to replace my code/cheat/ files)

Also as an excuse to learn more ruby in my spare time

== Release status

Ok, so it's less pre-alpha now. I've pushed it to Rubygems and it seems to work
in the limited testing that I've done.

== Credits and thanks

I used a lot the structure from codeplane to work out how to structure it. It's
obviously not as neat, but the gemspec was shamelessly adapted from codeplane
