= Twatterator

this is the tweety thing I used for the Singularity Summit

I plan to extend it into (yet another) basic cli tweet app that supports
multiple accounts so that I can harass the world relentlessly (basically use a
twitter feed to replace my code/cheat/ files)

Also as an excuse to learn more ruby in my spare time

== Release status

This is massively pre-alpha. I plan to do my best to leave it in a
consistent-ish state so that I can use it for day to day use, but the config
format is liable to change at short notice. If things suddenly fail, that's
probably a good place to look.
