CONFIG FILE
===========

This really does need to change, but I'm not sure where on the "Can piss off a userbase" scale I am, (ie, do I have one)

For now I'm going to leave it, and if it gets to 1.0 I'll fix it then.

COLORS!

twat -l should dump colors to terminal (This should be configurable tho)

Refactor tweet printing code, unify throughout
