twat -l -> <newsfeed>
twat -l [count] -> <count entries from newsfeed>
# Include who tweeted...

catch invalid options and return opts


CONFIG FILE
===========

This really does need to change, but I'm not sure where on the "Can piss off a userbase" scale I am, (ie, do I have one)

For now I'm going to leave it, and if it gets to 1.0 I'll fix it then.

COLORS!
=======

twat -l should dump colors to terminal (This should be configurable tho)

Refactor tweet printing code, unify throughout

TODO
====

Finish the config stuff (change --set-default <acct> to --set
DEFAULT=<acct>)
implement twat -f that just ticks by (have some option to ring a bell or
some shit)
