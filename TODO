catch invalid options and return opts

COLORS!
=======

Refactor tweet printing code, unify throughout


TODO
====

Output needs to live in it's own gem (since evidently more of these
tools will be written soon)

(which carries with it warnings if it's too short.. which means a warn
method.. which means abstracting it's output..)

On the upside, it'll make unit testing similar.  
(Add unit tests)

Split config and options out into submodules

Wrap all of the exception handling into a submodule, ie
with_handled_exceptions do
    <perform actions assuming everything went well>
end

(With handled exceptions contains the logic for yelling at the user for
being stupid, etc)

Allow upload of media files with the tweet via some kind of --attach
(Has implications for other endpoints because we need that data from the user or to infer it somehow)

PENDING
=======

Add some commands to retweet/favourite etc

Consider allowing to -f multiple accounts at once
