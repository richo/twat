catch invalid options and return opts

COLORS!
=======

Refactor tweet printing code, unify throughout


TODO
====

Output needs to live in it's own gem (since evidently more of these
tools will be written soon)

(which carries with it warnings if it's too short.. which means a warn
method.. which means abstracting it's output..)

On the upside, it'll make unit testing similar.  
(Add unit tests)

Split config and options out into submodules

Allow upload of media files with the tweet via some kind of --attach
(Has implications for other endpoints because we need that data from the user or to infer it somehow)

PENDING
=======

Add some commands to retweet/favourite etc

Consider allowing to -f multiple accounts at once

Refactor the calls to Twitter to hook my own object, which in turn hooks
the current_account to work out which service it uses.

(Bonus points for adding a hook which can also use an arbitrary user
specified url)

Allow -f #hashtag to follow that hashtag instead of your newsfeed

Seriously consider moving to subcommands

MOAR BACKENDS
=============

Abstract all the logic for the various operations (add, follow, post,
etc etc)

into a wrapper for each service so that twat can natively support
facebook, g+ etc etc as I get around to writing the new modules.
